## Python 3 on Raspberry Pi Raspbian

We need Pyton >=3.6, but currently Raspbian is based on Debian *stretch* that comes with Python 3.5. Hope Raspbian updates to Debian *buster* soon.

I've found Berryconda, a Python3.6 distro for Raspbian based in the well known Python distribution Anaconda that works well.

    Do you wish the installer to prepend the Berryconda3 install location
    to PATH in your /home/predic/.bashrc ? [yes|no]
    [no] >>> yes

I've found that it is needed to move the following `~/.bashrc` added lines to your `~/.profile`

    # added by Berryconda3 installer
    export PATH="/home/predic/berryconda3/bin:$PATH"
